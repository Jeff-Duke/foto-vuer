A place to upload some photos.  This project was built in `Vue.js` and is one of many projects from the [Turing School](https://turing.io).  Original project spec is [here.](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder.html)

There are seperate branches for each phase of the spec:

- [Phase2](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/foto-vuer/tree/phase-2)
- [Phase3](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/foto-vuer/tree/phase-3)
